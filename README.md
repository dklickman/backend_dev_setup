# backend_dev_setup
Overview:
Simple set up script to create a work environment for a new installation of ubuntu desktop or server.  This script is aimed at backend/api developers and includes my preferred tool set to get up and running quickly on a new machine or clone the script into a server that I will be working on.  This script requires root (sudo) user permissions therefore it is hightly encouraged the end user reviews the script prior to execution. 

Software Includes:
vim, git, youtube-dl, ffmpeg, code, postman, pyenv, chrome, docker

Configuration Files:
bash_aliases, .vimrc, .ssh_config,


ToDo: 
- VS code has a way to install extensions on the command line.  Look into to packaging up all favorite extensions: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery
- Easy way to grab private keys. For now they will be copied from a USB key until a secure solution can be implemented
