# backend_dev_setup
Overview:
Simple set up script to create a work environment for a new installation of ubuntu desktop or server.  This script is aimed at backend/api developers and includes my preferred tool set to get up and running quickly on a new machine or clone the script into a server that I will be working on.

Software Includes:
vim, git, code, postman, pyenv, chrome, docker

Configuration Files:
bash_aliases, .vimrc, .ssh_config,


ToDo: 
- Easy way to grab private keys. For now they will be copied from a USB key until a secure solution can be implemented
